### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn

### Steps

git clone https://github.com/your-username/oneapp-productivity.git
cd oneapp-productivity
npm install
npm run dev
```

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Supabase / Environment variables

This project uses Supabase on the client. To connect during development provide a `.env` file in the project root with the following keys (do not commit this file):

```dotenv
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

Vite exposes only variables prefixed with `VITE_` to client-side code. After adding the real values, restart the dev server. The app will print `"[supabase] Supabase client initialized."` in the browser console if successful.
